# SlideIO Python Wrapper

This repository provides a Python interface to the **SlideIO** library, a high-performance C++ image-reading framework designed for medical and biological slides. With SlideIO, you can read whole-slide images, extract specific regions, and scale large slides efficiently. The Python wrapper integrates these capabilities into a convenient API, returning image data as NumPy arrays.

## Overview

**SlideIO** is available as:
- A **C++ library** for efficient reading of whole-slide images, with support for multi-dimensional data (2D, 3D, and time series).
- A **Python module** that leverages the same C++ codebase, providing a Pythonic interface for reading images into NumPy arrays.

Key features include:
- **Whole-slide reading**: Load entire slides or specific regions of interest.  
- **Efficient scaling**: Rapidly generate scaled images from large slides using internal zoom pyramids.  
- **Format flexibility**: Handle diverse medical and biological imaging formats through an extensible driver system.

### Supported Image Formats

## Building on Linux with the Manylinux Docker Container

Below are instructions for building the Python wheels within a manylinux environment.

1. **Clone Repositories**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Booritas/slideio-python.git
   git clone https://github.com/Booritas/conan-center-index.git
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**  
   Map the parent directory containing these repositories into the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --name slideio -it \
     -v /path-to-slideio-python-parent-directory:/slideio-python/ \
     booritas/slideio-manylinux_2_28_x86_64:2.7.0 bash
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**  
   Within the container, point to the cloned repositories:
   ```bash
   export SLIDEIO_HOME=/slideio/slideio-python
   export CONAN_INDEX_HOME=/slideio/conan-center-index
   ```

4. **Build Custom Conan Packages**  
   ```bash
   cd /slideio/slideio-python
   ./conan.sh
   ```

5. **Install Conan Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   cd /slideio/slideio-python
   python3 ./install.py -a conan -c release
   ```

6. **Build Python Wheels**  
   ```bash
   cd /slideio/slideio-python
   ./build-wheels-manylinux.sh
   ```

7. **Locate the Wheel Packages**  
   You can find the resulting wheel files in the `wheelhouse` subdirectory of the `slideio-python` repository.
